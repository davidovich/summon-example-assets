Summon example data provider repo
=================================

This repository provides an example to create a [summon](https://github.com/davidovich/summon) data
provider.

You install this provider as `summon` and then can use the summon executable to
summon assets.

Using go get, you can provision every repo with versioned data, but managed in a
central fashion.
